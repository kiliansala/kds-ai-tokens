  - title: W3C DTCG Format
    details: Every token follows the W3C Design Token Community Group specification — $type, $value, $extensions.modes, and alias syntax.
  - title: Three-layer architecture
    details: Primitives → Semantic → ETX. Values cascade through alias chains so updating one primitive propagates everywhere.
  - title: Light/Dark modes
    details: Key, Status, and all ETX theme tokens carry both Light and Dark mode values in $extensions.modes.
  - title: 7 product themes
    details: Neutral, Events, Analytics, Locations, EcoTrafiX, Devices, and Messages — each with 251 color tokens.
